### Main questions proposed:
> What are the main borrowers' features that affect/have a relation to their ability to pay for and complete the loan in time?

> What are the main loans' features that affect the borrowers' ability to pay for and complete the loan in time? 

> We basically need to find who can complete the loan in time, and the type of loan that is high likely to be paid in time...

### Summary of Findings

In summary, we found that there are few main charactaristics that can affect / have a relation with / can predict the loan status or its payment or completion, and at the same time there are many variables that maybe logiacally does, actually doesn't. We found that the income is one of the main charactraistics that affect the loan's payment, high income people tend to pay more than low and average income people, beside that the employment status, the person have to be employed in order to be able to make income (in most of the cases). In addition to that we found that the small or less term/number of months provided to pay the dept will mostly cause a payment delay or other problems like cancelling the loan. Home ownership and available bank credit doesn't have any relation to the loan status, otherwise, dept to income ration plays an importnant role that the higher it is, the higher the probability that borrowers will not be able to complete the dept in time at least. Those are the main things we noticed that can predict the loan status and the one that we shouldn't logically consider as well.   


### Key Insights for Presentation

On the presentation, we are mainly investigating two types of variables for one purpose, this purpose is to proof or disproof the relationship and the effect of those variables on the loan status and payment. In the presentation, we individually explored both types of variables, showed an example or two for the exploration from each type, and its plot/graph. So you will find univariate graphs at the begaining.

At the next stage of the presentation, we started showing the multivariate graphs, they are the ones that proof our thoughts through the exploring process and answer the question, we showed two of them and they are confirming some of our previous thoughts and disconfirming some others, they have their own explanation anyways.
